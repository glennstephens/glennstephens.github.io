## Music is life

Having played music for over 32 years, music is one of my main things. Starting out as a songwriter, Glenn is well known as a pianist and keyboard player where he plays, but is a multi-instrumentalist and plays piano, guitar, bass, saxophone, flute, and a number of other instruments. Glenn's style is mostly pop-rock piano and counts Stevie Wonder, Ben Folds, The Darkness, Hoodoo Gurus, and Jacob Collier as his major past and modern influences. 

Glenn considers himself a composer first (Studied at the University of New England under [Ann Ghander](https://www.australianmusiccentre.com.au/artist/ghandar-ann)), and enjoys bringing pieces together of various styles. His current project is a musical comedy due to preview in 2022. 

## Recordings

While Glenn enjoys songwriting, he often writes with others such as Allan Casswell (winner of eight Golden Guitars) and Anthony Snape.
