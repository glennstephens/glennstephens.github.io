quote: "Glenn has that true talent as a musical comedian of being good enough to perform entirely as a musician or without his instrument in his hands at all. He creates songs that exist as earworms without the hilarious lyrics and punches out one-liners that would make Tim Vine blush. He's a true talent with an understated style that makes you double-take at some of the things he has to say."

## Standup Comedy

Glenn is known around Brisbane as a musical stand-up comedy, quite often with his trusty keytar. While he doesn't often travel outside of the Queensland bubble too much, Glenn performs shows in South East Brisbane areas. 

In additon, Glenn works at a well known corporate, so deliberately keeps his profle low, but is pashionate about club comedy, falling in love with the format while watching comedians at the Sydney Comedy Store in the early 2000's.
